{"name":"Michaelynn Welther","tagline":"Freelance Tutor. Student. Beginning Web Developer.","body":"### About Me\r\nAs a California native with a determined mindset, embracing the idea of \"work hard, play hard\" comes naturally to me. I am a recent graduate of El Segundo High School, and will be attending Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in the fall to study Applied Mathematics. I participated in my school's band and robotics teams, maintained above a 4.0 GPA, and taught myself Italian, HTML, and CSS on the side. On my free time I enjoy listening to music, hanging out with friends, learning new skills, browsing the Internet, and going to new places to try new things.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
