  <h2>July 19th, 2014</h2>
    <p>So I got my first "real" job last month, and so far it's been pretty great and has got me thinking. I like working, keeping myself busy, and just being
      useful. Hard work with adults is definitely different than what I considered hard work in high school. I've never demanded direct recognition when I worked hard,
      however I always frustrated when I wouldn't see everyone pulling their ends or helping out to reach the common goal. I wanted to feel like we as a team had
      a self-driven obligation, a sense of urgency that demanded ourselves rather than just others. That's what I enjoy about the people I work with; they all are driven and 
      ready to get shit done. I sense vibes of energy from the whole room rather than just from individuals. Maybe I just had high expectations for the high schoolers I worked with or am "ahead of my
      years" as Mr. Eno said, but it just makes my job feel worth it and myself feel productive and well-utilized when I'm working with a *team* for once rather than
      a group that has to be pushed. Of course, I did not expect these people to be lazy, but this appreciation came to mind once I saw their workflow. Everyone's really cool 
      though, and I do hope my future jobs have great groups of coworkers as these guys. ANOTHER SUPER AWESOME THING: Right before I wondered if they knew my Twitter account, so I said yolo and 
      followed the organization on Twitter, and before I started working at the office they were sending me out super friendly Tweets and stuff and that was awesome and yeah. 
      I'm proud that I get to extend my work period with them by another month, not only because of how unproductive I would be just hanging around for 7 weeks until college, but because these guys are a great group to work with.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, my friends and I think it's hilarious that I was basically the queen of social media at my school and now I'm working with it
      at my job. I guess it was meant to be.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from work, I've been hanging around, getting college necessities, and editing this git site. I'm really excited to go to college, I've already found
      my roommate, made the Mustang Band, and already have talked to some people who I think I can be good friends with. I'm super stoked that I already have 39 units
      completed out of 180 because of LMU and AP crap, so my first semester I guess they decided to only give me 12 units? The great thing about the courses they gave me though
      is that only one class seems pretty difficult: Calc IV. Other than that they gave me Writing and Rhetoric, and American and Californian Govt. Talking politics is my forte
      and English should be easy considering I managed to write some A-grade essays in Lit without reading the books (AP Bullshit?). I was thinking of switching into Comp Sci my second
      quarter, so I might take the beginner's Comp Sci course in a addition to my other courses so I don't have to shove it in next quarter. But yeah, super stoked for college.
    </p>
    <p>I guess I could just say life is good right now and hopefully about to get great.</p>
  <h2>June 7th, 2014</h2>
    <p>These past four years have been wonderful, and I leave the high school with no regrets. You are lucky to go to El Segundo High, 
    if you hate this wonderful high school, then I advise you to take part in more activities, be open to other viewpoints, and don't be scared of 
    having fun. High school isn't about being perfect, it's about finding who YOU are, and exenuating yourself to see how successful you can be 
    among diverse crowds. Cliques do not exist if you forget about them, perfect grades do not matter if you understand the value of education, 
    and haters do not matter if you can love who you are and stay confident with your decisions. I am proud of how I've grown as a person, all 
    it took was opening my mind. My one big piece of advice: Don't ever demand gratitude or apologies, demand yourself. Thank you everyone for 
    having an influence on me in some way, small or large. You are truly wonderful, and I wish you all the best in your future ventures.</p>
